## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Tried to lean in on this challenge and not use media queries to manage the responsiveness. I think I was able to acheive that but there are small parts that I needed to code into specific classes. I am still exploring what's the best way to make designs responsive without coding each individual element.
